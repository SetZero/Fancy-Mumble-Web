# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently we don't have any stable versions, but if we ever add a stable version this will be the only additional supported version besides the master branch version.
The master branch is always up-to-date and should therefore be free of any security issues (there is no guarantee that this is actually the case).
If you find any issue in **stable** or **master** please report them!

| Version   | Supported          |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| master    | :white_check_mark: |
| stable    | :white_check_mark: |
| oldstable | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any non-critical security issues in a ticket. If you find a cirital error, which can cause a security breach or denial of service, please contact me directly 
([@SetZero](https://github.com/SetZero)) or open a draft security advisory. 

Please write the exact steps to reproduce the vulnerability including (if necessary) your environment and possible outcomes of the issue.

You may write a ticket or publish the issue, if I don't write you back within a month. 

If the vulnerability is accepted I will try the give you an approximate timeframe up until the issue will be resolved. If the issue isn't resolved within that timeframe and 
I haven't written back that it might take longer you are free to publish the vulnerability.
If a vulnerability has been declined and you think that I misunderstood the severity you may write back and explain it again. If I still decline the vulnerability you are free
to publish it.
